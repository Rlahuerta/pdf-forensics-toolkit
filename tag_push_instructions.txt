# Instructions for Pushing the v1.0.0 Tag

The git tag `v1.0.0` has been created locally and points to the latest commit.

To push the tag to GitHub, run:

git push origin v1.0.0

After pushing the tag, you can create a draft release on GitHub:
1. Go to: https://github.com/Rlahuerta/pdf-forensics-toolkit/releases/new
2. Select tag: v1.0.0
3. Follow the instructions in RELEASE.md

Note: The tag must be pushed before creating the GitHub release.
